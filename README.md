My repository containing my small blog of articles on various topics and my book


# My small Golb.

Place where I'm sharing my knowledge for others primarily my future me.

Why suddenly create this blog?

- Provide value to others. I believe everyone should strive to provide value to others.
- Improve my writing and literacy skills by forcing myself to write and learn new vocabulary.
    - Writing is an area I particularly would like to improve in.

# Book reviews

Reviews of all the books I have read.

Keep track of the main useful concepts of each book.

This process of summarizing a book.

I strive to memorize all the chapters

I am forcing myself to read books.

# Few notes

- All my articles will be in markdown.

- I am not excluding of using an LLM to help me generating some of the content even though I will strive to not. If I happen to do it, I will mention it.

- I will strive to be intellecutally honest.

- I might sometimes write in French, my native language.
