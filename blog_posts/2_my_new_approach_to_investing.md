# My new approach to investing

Since the inception in mid 2023 of my investments in the stock market, I have relatively significantly "underperformed" the market.

By underperforming the market, I mean obtaining a lower risk-adjusted performance compared to the S&P 500.

Why did I select the S&P 500 and not another index like QQQ or MSCI World as a market benchmark?

Well because the U.S. is the market you want to be invested in.

Why, because the U.S. is the biggest oil and gas producer and consumer in the world, contains almost all the major top tech companies (Google, Apple, Microsoft or Nvidia just to name a few) powering technological growth and attracts the most talented people in the world looking for its high standard livings. For all these reasons, the U.S. has been and will continue outperforming the rest of world economically.

Risk-adjusted performance can be computed using metrics such as the "Sharpe Ratio", "Sortino Ratio" or "Return by Max Drawdown".

Why did I underperform the market?

For many reasons:
- I was not invested in enough US companies.
- I didn't hold enough tech companies like MSFT or didn't top performing ones like NVDA.
- Invested in sectors with small / declining growth like mining.

My strategy is to invest in companies with relatively low "Forward Price to Eearnings" that will experience a decent growth in the next few years.

I am planning to continue investing a significant fraction of my money in stocks.
